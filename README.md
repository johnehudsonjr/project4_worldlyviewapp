# Country Review APp
Overview
This project came at me very fast. I had this very adventurous idea to create a social network using MERN which required me to do a lot of research on user authentication, hashing passwords, redux... a lot. Due to the time-frame I needed to quickly change my idea to something I can do without much hassle.

# Background
The basic concept of the app is to post places I have been among the three continents I have visited for people to see my review on the place and determine if they should go back.

# Moving Forward
I will do a better job at styling. I want to also add functionality for others to signup/login and create their own places they have been.
It would also be cool to have a landing page map as well.
